4. An .osm file containing a sample part of the map region you used (around 1 - 10 MB in size). See instructor notes.

5. A text file containing a list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc that you referred to or used in this submission (Add N/A if you did not use such resources).

Then go back to your Udacity Home, click on the project, and follow the instructions to submit:
• If you want to submit your files through a "Link to Project", upload your project files onto Github and send us the link.
• If you instead want to submit your files through "Upload a Zip", compress your project directory, and submit that zip file.

It can take us up to a week to grade the project, but in most cases it is much faster. You will get an email once your submission has been reviewed.

If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at dataanalyst-project@udacity.com.
